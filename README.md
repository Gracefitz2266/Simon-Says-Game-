# Simon-Says-Game-
The Simon electronic memory skill game,  is a classic game of memory and concentration. Players must replicate sequences of lights and tones generated by the game, which become progressively longer and more challenging as the game advances. The game uses four colored buttons, each producing a unique tone when pressed or activated. The player must repeat the pattern by pressing the buttons in the same order. Failure to replicate the sequence or a delay results in game over
